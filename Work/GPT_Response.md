Yes, you can enable **Temporary Access Pass (TAP)** functionality using Microsoft Intune, as part of your organization's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) configuration. To do so, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure that your organization is using Azure AD (or Hybrid Azure AD).
- You need the proper role-based access control (RBAC) permissions in Intune and Azure AD (e.g., Global Administrator, Authentication Administrator).

### Steps to Enable TAP using Intune and Azure AD:

1. **Enable TAP in Azure AD:**
   1. Sign in to the **Azure AD** portal as an administrator.
   2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Authentication Methods**.
   3. Under **Policies**, select **Temporary Access Pass**.
   4. Set **Enable Temporary Access Pass** to **Yes**.
   5. Define the TAP policies, such as:
      - Lifetime of the pass (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).
      - Whether it is single-use or multi-use.
   6. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

2. **Configure the Intune Device Compliance Policies:**
   1. In **Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune)**, go to **Devices** > **Compliance Policies** > **Policies**.
   2. Create or edit an existing policy to ensure that **Passwordless sign-in** is allowed on devices.
   3. You can also specify device compliance rules, such as enforcing the registration of a passwordless method (FIDO2, Windows Hello for Business) for users.

3. **Ensure Devices are Azure AD Joined or Hybrid Joined:**
   - For TAP to work, the devices must be either **Azure AD joined** or **Hybrid Azure AD joined**. In Intune, you can configure automatic device enrollment in Azure AD if not already set up. Go to **Devices** > **Windows enrollment** to configure the appropriate settings.

4. **Distribute TAP to Users:**
   - You will need to issue the **Temporary Access Pass** to users via the **Azure AD** portal:
     1. Navigate to the userâ€™s account in Azure AD.
     2. Under **Authentication methods**, add **Temporary Access Pass** and define its parameters.
   - Share the TAP with the user to use during sign-in.

### Intune Enrollment Configuration:
Ensure that your devices are enrolled into Intune and connected to Azure AD for these settings to take effect. You can use **Intune Enrollment Policies** to ensure all devices are properly managed.

### User Experience:
Once TAP is enabled, users can select the TAP sign-in option from the **Windows sign-in screen** under **Sign-in options**.

By following these steps, you can enable TAP functionality and allow users to authenticate to their computers using a Temporary Access Pass in a secure and managed environment.
